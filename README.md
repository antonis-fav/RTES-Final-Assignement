# RTES-Final-Assignement

Aristotle University 2022 

This is the final assignement for the course "Real time embedded systems". 

The final code inside the client.c is based on a client that connects to finnhub while using libwebsockets and it was created by a fellow colleague.
You can find the source code of that client and extensive documentation regarding the installation of libwebsockets here https://github.com/GohanDGeo/lws-finnhub-client.

That source code was modified in order to implement the basic ideas and mechanisms of this source code here: 
https://github.com/antonis-fav/Emdedded-Systems-Assignment-1. 

You can find the slightly upadated version of the client.c inside the branch of this repository. In this updated version we remove any compiler warnings regarding typecasts and we are monitoring more than 4 stocks.
